My Portfolio

## The assigment:
This assignment was to create a multiple page portfolio with an index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html and in each of these pages we were expected to add 
   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

Each of these had to be fluid throughout the whole project with a nav bar on each page as well as a background with a foreground container holding the elements of the page. These elements had to be labeled using semantic tags which in turn could be used to style aforementioned tags successfully in css if the tags were not correct co styling would take place. Also all the links in the nav bar needed to be functional and navigate the user to the correct page that was clicked. Each page also had to work in multiple size screens from xs to xl wide screens. Also the implementation of bootstrap library of styling. All HTML was also run through a HTML validation on Google and all errors were corrected.

## Lessons:
In this assignment I learned multiple styling attributes as well as the way to implement bootstrap to help with the bulk of the coding that before the introduction of bootstrap seemed like a very daunting task. I learned how to take the bootstrap styling and adapt to what I needed it to do. Also I learned how to style the pages for different media mediums (xs to xl wide screens) this was done by adding a media query to the css styling page. This assignment also helped me to be more comfortable with css styling and how it relates to the html. This assignment allowed me a little bit of creative freedom to start from scratch and design it from nothing. I know I learned alot from this assignment and value the activity greatly. 


## Takeaways:
What I took from this assignment was alot of information and alot of styling points about css and jquery. It helped me to understand how and why these are used to help develop more compatible and user freindly websites. This is a big thing to make sure your website is at the top of the search and also works well on all formats and/or browsers. Also I tackled the first part of the bonus and successfully made a sticky footer for all of my pages.
